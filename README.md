## Installation

Requires Nvim 0.11 or later (lower versions may work but are not tested).

This plugin can be installed using any package manager that supports Git repo, such as `lazy.nvim`, `vim-plug`, etc.
Or you can also use built-in `package` feature of Neovim
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brianhuster/qfpeek.nvim ~/.config/nvim/pack/plugins/start/qfpeek.nvim
```

**NOTE**: This plugin doesn't require lazy-loading, because it is lazy-loaded by default.

See [:h qfpeek](doc/qfpeek.txt) for more information on usage and configuration.
